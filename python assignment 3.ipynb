    "\n",
    "Ans: Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.... A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function's return value."

The modified 'total' variable inside the function then it was not reflected outside the function. Because inside function func() total variable is treated as local variable."
